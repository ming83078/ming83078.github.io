                                    <p>The majority of older adults use an increasing number of medications as they
                                        become older. 25% to 40% of adults aged 65 years or older are prescribed at
                                        least 5 medications. Management of adherence, which is the process of supporting
                                        and monitoring patients’ adherence to medication is a challenge for older adults
                                        because of their impairments of sensation, perception, and cognition. <br><br>
                                        This is

                                        Systems in the Department of Computer Science at Umeå University in

                                        different countries, Swedish field experts and target users between November
                                        2017 and March 2018.
                                    </p><br>

                                    <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                                    <p id="a4">Exploring target users and stakeholders’ needs for medication management
                                        with using pillboxes.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        Many different kinds of technology have been developed to support older adults’
                                        medication management and improve their medication adherence. However, the
                                        intervention technology is unlikely to increase older adults’ medication
                                        adherence including correct medication distribution and the evidence is limited.
                                        The reason is the designs of technology are technology-driven and lack of
                                        situated exploring. Therefore, the team decided to conduct context inquiry. I
                                        visited the homebound elderly and interviewed them and field experts to collect
                                        and analyze their needs. Afterwards, I shared findings with the team to design
                                        the application.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        This is a bottom-up project, which means the team had to coordinate the existing
                                        resources to make a quick development and test. The users and field experts
                                        participated in each design and evaluation process.

                                    <p>
                                        The project was planned in an academic unit so the theoretical-based structure
                                        was necessary. In addition, a solid cognitive and artificial intelligence
                                        foundation supported the scientific validity of the project and the application.
                                        The design process based on Activity theory and formal argumentation theory,
                                        which provided the structures of behavior analysis of the medication

                                    <h3>The Approach</h3>
                                    <p id="a4">Deep in the literature</p>
                                    <p>
                                        An efficient literature review gave an overall view of design possibilities. I
                                        reviewed the literature systematically from device and co-design perspectives. I
                                        found:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <strong>1. Possible technology
                                        </strong><br>
                                        AR can be an efficient technology to improve older adults’ daily independency
                                        and control since AR can be located and used in their familiar, daily
                                        environments. In addition, the projection-based AR application is especially
                                        appropriate to support the medication distribution for older adults because
                                        users can practice with their hands the actions and the unlimited display size
                                        enables users who have poor vision to read relative instruction clearly.

                                        The keys to succeeding and to avoiding the failures of past eHealth/AI efforts
                                        are user-centered design, evaluation from the beginning, and interdisciplinary
                                        collaboration with medical experts.

                                        Besides the inputs of literature review, we used participatory design methods to
                                        comprehensively understand the process of using pill dispensers to manage
                                        medications in older adults. In addition, this method provided the users and
                                        stakeholders to present their needs and opinions.<br><br>

                                    <p id="a4">Certain requirements of medication information</lp>
                                        <p>
                                            The participating older adults relied on medication dispensers to manage
                                            their medications. When older adults distribute their medications to the
                                            dispensers, they need certain information about the medications and
                                            prescriptions, which is the same information that caregivers need.

                                            The different sources of information were viewed as sources of stress and
                                            confusion, for they caused worries that the patients might miss something
                                            important. In addition, sometimes the medication provided might vary in
                                            appearance from time to time because the healthcare system provides the
                                            cheapest
                                            brand, which changes over time. Therefore, older adults relies on the label
                                            of
                                            medication instruction on medication packages to distribute medication.
                                            However,
                                            the font size of the medication instruction labels were too small to read
                                            easily.<br><br>
                                            <em>“What is said on the label is really important. Even though the doctor
                                                said
                                                but you didn’t listen to him, maybe you were thinking about what to do
                                                next
                                                and you missed some information what doctor said that was not on the

                                            occasionally. Moreover, the older adults mentioned that some medications

                                            <p>In this scenario, the user could perform medication distributing
                                                independently. The assistive system does not take any decisions
                                                oriented to support the activity. The role of an assistive system is
                                                observe and learn without suggesting active support.</p>

                                            <li><strong>Activities supported by caregiver<br></strong></li>
                                            <p> In this scenario, an individual receives support from another
                                                person, for example a caregiver. Similarly to the last scenario, the
                                                role of an assistive system is observe and learn without suggesting
                                                active support.</p>

                                            <li><strong>Activities supported by an assistive system<br></strong>
                                            </li>
                                            <p>In this scenario, an assistive agent takes the decision to support an
                                                individual by taking active decisions such as projecting the
                                                abstracted medication instructions.</p>

                                            <li><strong>Activities supported by both caregiver and
                                                    agent<br></strong></li>
                                            <p>This scenario involves the joint support provided the client by both
                                                a caregiver and an assistive system. A main challenge for the
                                                assistive system is to detect: (1) actions that the caregiver
                                                executes, and (2) observations of the caregiver and client.</p>

                                                see
                                                very clearly. Because it is a problem that the text is small on the
                                                packages and there is a lot of the text on the package. So I think

                                                is really clear. I also like the picture of the box and pills

                                                the challenge is there are a lot of boxes with different names and
