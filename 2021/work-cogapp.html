                                    <h3>Brain Win! A cognitive training game.</h3>
                                    <p>The number of elderly people in the world is increasing rapidly. To cope with
                                        aging populations, governments and institutions around the world such as WHO
                                        have proposed various guidelines. The purpose of these guidelines is generally
                                        to propose how <strong id="a3">elderly people’s cognition </strong>ccan be
                                        maintained and to encourage their social participation. In this project, the
                                        team and I designed a user-friendly cognitive training game for elderly people,
                                        which based on their demands and living contexts.
                                    </p>

                                <h3>My Role</h3>
                                <p id="a4">Contextual inquiry</p>
                                <p>I conducted interviews with older adults and field experts in a daily-care nursing
                                    home to explore their demands and preferences of mobile-based games. Meanwhile, I
                                    investigated the cognitive training activities in the daily care institution.
                                    <br><br>
                                    The findings helped to design the game with familiar content for older adults which
                                    is good for their cognitive processing.
                                </p>
                                <p id="a4">Structure definition</p>
                                <p>I systematically reviewed theories of age-related cognitive impairments and mobile
                                    games. I integrated the results of the contextual inquiry and the literature review
                                    to propose the content structure of the game. This helped to construct a reliable
                                    and scientific foundation for the game design.
                                </p>
                                <p id="a4">Prototype evaluation</p>
                                <p>I planned the prototype evaluations and I conducted them in older adults’ homes. I
                                    analyzed the results which were used to validate the acceptance of the game and
                                    refine the design of it.

                                <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                                <p>Although previous studies and projects on digital games have provided valuable
                                    insight into cognitive training and also suggested design principles for the content
                                    and interactions, they have:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Not frequently used multiple sources (such as stakeholder attitudes and
                                            qualitative and quantitative sources) for analysis.</li>
                                        <li>Not considered older adults’ daily experiences and not applied them in game
                                            design.</li>
                                        <li>Seldom tested games in a realistic context such as homes and nursing homes.
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                    In terms of game devices, a mobile tablet-based training app has several advantages
                                    that are especially beneficial for training older adults. For example, the screen
                                    size of tablets fits older adults’ visual abilities better than smartphones.
                                    <br><br>
                                    In sum, our goal for the project was to design a high acceptance and user-friendly
                                    mobile game of cognitive training for older adults according to their lives and
                                    demands. Specifically, our high-level goals were to:<br>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Determine what types of cognitive training do elderly people accept in a
                                            mobile game.</li>
                                        <li>Identify what components are crucial to improving or reducing the usability
                                            of a cognitive training game for elderly people.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </p>
                                <br><br>
                                <h3>The Approach</h3>
                                <p id="a4">Design-based research</p>
                                <p>To address the need to clarify how older users’ cognitive functions can be enhanced
                                    by game training in a genuine context with stakeholders, this study adopted the
                                    research method framework of design-based research (DBR) to investigate the complex
                                    phenomenon. The features of DBR includes that:< <ul>
                                        <li>DBR focuses on <strong id="a3">the development of hypotheses and a framework
                                                and
                                                the contribution to model formulation</strong>, rather than model
                                            estimation
                                            or validation. </li>
                                        <li>DBR typically <strong id="a3">triangulates multiple sources and types of
                                                data
                                            </strong> to connect intended and unintended outcomes of processes of
                                            enactment,
                                            and it increases the validity of findings through its typical partnerships
                                            and
                                            iteration.</li>
                                        <li>DBR enables researchers to grasp problems through <strong id="a3">iterative
                                                development</strong> and places emphasis on the <strong
                                                id="a3">authenticity
                                                of the context</strong>.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        In this project, we designed a DBR process with two cycles.</p>

                                    day-care nursing home and interviewed a professional manager of it. I analyzed the
                                    data and proposed the matrix of cognitive training activities and effectiveness in
                                    the day-care nursing home. This result helped to design the tasks in the game.</p>

                                <p id="a4">The winner of life–Daily game</p>
                                <p>Whilst our competitors focus on creating a virtual context (car race, hotel
                                    management, firemen, etc.) in games to train older adults’ cognition, our vision was
                                    to use familiar components to help users connect their capability between the
                                    virtual and the real world. Therefore, we expected that the users can train their
                                    cognition, then resulting in a better daily life. We proposed a few specific
                                    principles to reach the vision. </p>

                                    participants had to read the map and draw the route to the market. Afterwards, the
                                    participants had to buy three ingredients with a budget of NT$100. During this task,
                                    the participants had to concentrate on the information icons and remember the costs

                                    word and select the corresponding icon. The auditory cue trained participants to
                                    search their semantic memory and retrieve the corresponding icon.</p>

                                <p>In the first cycle, I used competitors’ cognitive training apps which corresponded to
                                    the structure of cognitive training but were lack of content design to evaluate
                                    target users’ attitudes toward them. I also observed the interactions between users
                                    and the interface of the apps. The evaluation was in the local day-care nursing
                                    home. </p>

                                    more intuitive, and this mode was indicated by the textual instruction and a
