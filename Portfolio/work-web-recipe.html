                                    <p>In recent years, people start to concern about food education. Understanding what
                                        we eat daily and the process from farms to tables is not only associated to our
                                        personal health, but also the environment. In addition, food safety incidents
                                        broke out one after another, which led to people begin to cook at homes and make
                                        the importance of recipes to increase. <br><br>
                                        This project focuses on the picture/text ratio of webpage-based recipe. We
                                        explore the effects of it on cognitive load and performances of reading
                                        comprehension, which are the vital factors of creating a better leaning
                                        experience. <br><br>
                                        We use <strong id="a3">eye movement </strong>experiment and questionnaire to
                                        examine
                                        which kind of picture/text ratio of recipe will cause better learning effect.

                                <p id="a4">Project supervising</p>
                                <p>This project was conducted in the course of Research on Human-computer Interface. I
                                    was the teaching assistant and <strong id="a3"> I supervised the master students
                                        with information
                                        science and communication backgrounds </strong>to design and carry out the
                                    experiments and
                                    analyze the data.
                                </p>
                                <p id="a4">Team building</p>
                                <p>Besides supervising, I created a cooperative and active teamwork atmosphere to lead
                                    the students to produce high-quality outcomes and have fun in the course as well.
                                </p><br><br>
                                <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                                <p id="a4">From theory to hands-on practice</p>
                                <p>The teachers and I used the teaching strategy of problem-based learning in the class.
                                    We guided the students to critically discuss multimedia theories. We encouraged the
                                    students to apply those theories to cooperatively exploring the factors of
                                    multimedia learning performance in real contexts. <br><br>
                                    Therefore, we let the students
                                    take part in the project of <strong id="a3"> Special Exhibition: Scientific
                                        Exploration on the Dining Table</strong>, which was funded by the Ministry of
                                    Science and Technology. The goal of the project was to facilitate popular science of
                                    food safety and cooking to the public by providing them a multimedia learning
                                    environment of the topic.</p>

                                <p>The students made a team and designed the webpage-based recipes with <strong
                                        id="a3">different picture/text ratio </strong>to examine which kinds of the
                                    webpages can result in better learning experience. I guided the team to polish
                                    their research questions and experimental design and supervised them conducting
                                    the experiments.</p>

                                <p>TThe common data of user study is from self-report questionnaires, which might be
                                    impacted by participants’ conscious of the experiment purposes. Thus, we used the
                                    MengoldVision eye tracking system to obtain a physiological measurement, which truly
                                    records and reflects users’ cognitive processing and behaviors.</p>

                                <p id="a4">Deep in literature</p>
                                <p>According to <strong id="a3"> cognitive load theory and dual coding theory </strong>,
                                    we proposed that learning performance can be referred to the following components.
                                </p>
                                <li>cognitive load</li>
                                <li>usability</li>
                                <li>reading comprehension</li>
                                <li>attention processing</li>
                                <br>
                                <p>
                                    On the other hands, the <strong id="a3">picture superiority effect </strong>argues
                                    that the instructions with
                                    pictures provide better learning performance than the ones with texts only.
                                    Therefore, we wondered which kinds of picture/text ratio of webpage-based recipes
                                    will cause better learning performance. We proposed three different kinds of the
                                    webpage designs to examine the effects.
                                </p>

                                    asked to read the recipe of brownie. <br><br>
                                    Meanwhile, their eye movements were recorded to
                                    evaluate their attention processing. Afterwards, they were requested to respond to
                                    the questionnaires of NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX), the System Usability Scale
                                    (SUS), and reading comprehension, which were used to measure cognitive load,
                                    usability, and reading comprehension respectively.

                                <ul>
                                    <li>The cognitive load, the usability, and the reading comprehension are not
                                        statistically different between the three webpage designs.</li>
                                    <li>In terms of average gaze time, which represents users’ attention processing, the
                                        FT
                                        shows the shortest gaze time than FP and FTP. FTP shows the longest gaze time.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>The gaze time of text is statistically different from that of pictures when
                                        performing the three webpages respectively.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p id="a4">Show the steps clearly</p>
                                <p>The content of the recipe was not complex for the users. The key is that the concise
                                    descriptions of divided task steps are the basic demands for users. This design help
                                    users to efficiently construct the procedural knowledge.</p>
                                <p id="a4">Relay on text learning</p>
                                <p>Users mainly rely on text reading and comprehensions to construct procedural
                                    knowledge of cooking. On the other hand, pictures are the add-on information for
                                    them to understand the results of their performing.</p>
                                <p id="a4">Reduce redundancy</p>
                                <p>The design of focusing both on text and picture (FTP) required the longest time to
                                    read. That is because the users cross referenced the text on the pictures and the
                                    step descriptions. However, the learning performance of using the FTP is not
                                    statistically different from the design of focusing on text (FT) and focusing on
                                    picture (FP). That is, the design of FTP results in the redundant effect especially
                                    on reading time. Therefore, designers need to weight the text which is presented in
                                    the pictures and choose the necessary text to present only.</p>
